## Machine Learning Problem Solving Process

Example problem: Imagine you are an analyst at a small city with a big flooding problem.

City manager asks you if it rains 240mm this year, how much flood damage will there be?

- Identify data that is relevant to the problem

- Assemble a set of data related to the problem you're trying to solve

- Decide on the type of output you are predicting

- Based on the type of output, pick an algorithm that will determina a correlation between your 'features' and 'labels'

- Use model generated by algorithm to make a prediction

If the amount of annual rainfall (independent variable aka feature) changes, we will probably see a change in flood damage costs (dependent variable aka label)

- if rain goes up, we predict more damage costs

- think how would we put the data together?

- look up rainfall (mm) for each year and reported budget of city in each year (million $) -> regression prediction technique

- based on output you're predicting, you can try out a certain algorithm

  - classification: the value of our labels belong to a discrete set

    - predictions with classification techniques: based on how many hours a student studied for an exam, did they pass or fail (pass/fail), based on the content of this email, is it spam or not spam (spam/not spam), based on where a football player shoots from, are they likely to score or not score (score/note score)

  - regression: the value of our labels belong to a continuous set

    - predictions with regression techniques: based on the year, make, and model, what is its value (0 to 50k), based on an individual's daily calorie intake and minutes spent exercising, what is their weight (80 to 400lb), based on the height of this pine tree, what is its age (0 to 500 years)

- given dataset -> pass through linear regression algorithm -> found relationship between annual rainfall and amount of money required to spend on damages -> get formula relationsihp -> plug in numbers and uncover the damage costs

- features are categories of data points that affect the value of a label (identifying the independent and dependent variables)

- assembling set of data related to problem you're trying to solve -> datasets almost always need cleanup/formatting

- decide on the type of output you are predicting i.e. regression with continuous values, classification with discrete values

- based on the type of output, pick an algorithm that will determine a correlation between your features and labels

- use model generated by algorithm to make prediction -> modls relate the value of features to the value of labels
